# Commit Message Guidelines

For the Node Enrollment Experiments repository, follow these commit message conventions:

## Format
```
<type>: <description>

[required body for exp type - describe rationale and experiment context]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types
Use one of these minimal commit types:
- `docs`: Documentation changes (README updates, experiment notes, how-to guides)
- `decide`: Decision records (governance voting points, architectural choices, policy decisions)
- `exp`: Experimental/exploratory work (node enrollment patterns, vault integration, infrastructure experiments)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, tooling setup

## Description Guidelines
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Start with lowercase letter
- No period at the end
- Keep under 50 characters when possible
- Be descriptive but concise

## Experiment-Specific Rules
For `exp` commits, the experiment ID is automatically determined from the directory structure:
- Working in `/experiments/001/` → experiment 001
- Working in `/experiments/002/` → experiment 002

**Subject requirements:**
- Describe experiment lifecycle change (start, iterate, conclude, pivot, abandon, resume, etc.)
- Focus on node enrollment patterns, vault integration, or infrastructure approaches

**Body requirements:**
- Must describe the rationale and reference the experiment context
- Explain why this change is being made

## Examples
```
docs: document initial findings and observations
decide: establish commit message guidelines
decide: adopt experimental repository structure
exp: start vault integration experiment
exp: iterate on node enrollment approach
exp: conclude with basic deployment
exp: pivot to alternative approach
exp: resume after dependency fix
exp: start performance measurement setup
chore: update Docker Compose dependencies
```

## Example with Body
```
exp: start vault integration experiment

Testing Infisical as a vault solution for node enrollment.
Establishing baseline measurements and understanding
integration patterns to enable future comparisons.

Working in experiment 001 directory.
```
